1. Place the .exe anywhere
2. Run the script and simply follow on-screen instructions
3. Costumes load automatically now
4. For NPCs like Angel Jin, True Devil Kazuya and Story Devil Jin, you cannot pick any other character, they will always be loaded, no matter what
5. Optionally, you can use the Cheat Table to load the correct HUD icons and character names. Just attach it and activate both scripts in it.
